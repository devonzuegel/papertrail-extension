# Set up
## Install Server Dependencies
Run the following commands to install all server dependencies on into the `node_modules` folder.
````
npm install
npm install -g nodemon
````

## Start MongoDB
`cd` into your project directory. Execute the following commands to run `mongod`. Keep this terminal open.
````
mongod --dbpath data
````

## Run the Node server
Open a new terminal and run the node server. `nodemon` and `supervisor` are tools that run node and automaticall restart each time you make changes to the server so that you don't have to manually restart.
````
nodemon app.js
````
or
````
supervisor app
````

You should now see the starter application at localhost:3000 (or, equivalently, 127.0.0.1:3000) in your browser.

**Note:** If you see `‘Error: failed to connect to [localhost:27017]’`, then MongoDB isn’t running. Make sure to run it using the mongod command above.

# Terminology
## Post
A post represents a photo, song, or video that’s on the newsfeed. Each post contains the following fields: 

1. `api` (which API the post is derived from), 
2. `title` (the title of the post), 
3. `source` (a Flickr, SoundCloud, or YouTube source URL), and
4. `upvotes` (the number of upvotes the post has received).
