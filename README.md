# About

The impact of corporate political contributions is largely opaque to the general public. We aim to better inform consumers about the companies they patronize and in turn the political causes they support. To solve this problem, we built a browser extension that exposes the political implications of the products in your Amazon cart. The extension enables consumers to play a more active, conscious role in politics. With Paper Trail, you can vote with your wallet.
